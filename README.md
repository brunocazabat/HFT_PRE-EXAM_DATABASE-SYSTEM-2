# HFT_PRE-EXAM_DATABASE-SYSTEM-2
Project in Python using MySQL to demonstrate Databases use in Software.
The goal of this Python Application would be to display and select pizza combination/recipes depending on ingredients you would like to eat, or depending of your allergies.
Meet now: "The Ultimate Pizza Selector".


Note that the program "table_injector.py" is executed also in "Pizza_Database_Project.py".
In the case where you want only to deploy the DB, just execute "table_injector.py".
